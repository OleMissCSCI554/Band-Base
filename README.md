A user’s buddy management and buddy List page: Scheme: In this page, a user can add or delete one person as his buddy. The page displays all friends and bands played with. 
Slides and PHP files: Slide 8 
Coding suggestions: Simple way to create the buddy list: We need a buddy table with fields user_id and friend_id. Second field is a foreign key of another user_id or a band_id. Now we can connect bands with users and users with users. We also need a buddylist.php for sending sql requests to the database and provide the data to the buddylist - website (probably buddylist.js). To add or delete a buddy to your list we could have a makebuddy.php which receives a id as parameter and add a new record to the buddy table (f.e. : http://bandbase.com/makebuddy.php?buddyid=$buddyid). We could add a "add buddy" button to the profile page and when clicking on it, the current userid of this profile will be send to the make buddy.php file.
